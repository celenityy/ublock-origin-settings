# ublock-origin-settings

My recommendations for the ultimate configuration of uBlock Origin :)

**NOTE:** This project can be found on both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/celenity/ublock-origin-settings), which will act as the main & preferred way to contribute, and [GitHub](https://github.com/celenityy/ublock-origin-settings).

# Settings

Privacy:

* **Disable pre-fetching (to prevent any connection for blocked network requests)** -> ✅

* **Disable hyperlink auditing** -> ✅

* **Block CSP reports** -> ✅

* **Uncloak canonical names** -> ✅

<br>

Default behavior:

* **Disable JavaScript** -> ✅ *(This **will** cause breakage, but it heavily improves privacy & security, so I'd recommend enabling it if possible and if you're willing to re-enable JavaScript that need it)*

<br>

Advanced:

* **I am an advanced user** -> ✅

# Filter lists

**Auto-update filter lists** -> ✅

**Suspend network activity until all filter lists are loaded** -> ✅

**Parse and enforce cosmetic filters** -> ✅

**Ignore generic cosmetic filters** -> ❌

Here's where it gets fun, to the lists. I would generally recommend enabling **all** of the built-in filters, **besides** those under the `Regions, languages` category. These are all extremely carefully picked lists with strong coverage and minimal breakage, and **I would recommend enabling them for the best coverage possible**.

Built-in:

* ⭐️ `uBlock filters` -> ✅

<br>

Ads:

* ⭐️ `EasyList` -> ✅

* ⭐️ `AdGuard - Ads` -> ✅

* ⭐️ `AdGuard - Mobile Ads` -> ✅

<br>

<br>

Custom:

I would recommend importing the following lists:

* ⭐️ `Actually Legitimate URL Shortener Tool` - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/LegitimateURLShortener.txt`

* ⭐️ `Divested - Fingerprinting` - `https://divested.dev/blocklists/Fingerprinting.ubl`

* ⭐️ Yokoffing's `Block third party fonts`: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokoffing/filterlists/main/block_third_party_fonts.txt`

Additionally, if you don't have a DNS content blocking solution in place *(you should)*, or you just can't use the relevant list on your DNS blocker, you should import the following:

* ⭐️ My `BadBlock`: `https://codeberg.org/celenity/BadBlock/raw/branch/main/abp/badblock.txt`

* ⭐️ `Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List`: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/master/Dandelion%20Sprout's%20Anti-Malware%20List.txt`

* ⭐️ `Divested Combined Blocklist`: `https://divested.dev/hosts-domains-wildcards`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's Badware Host Blocking`: `https://gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror/-/raw/main/dns-blocklists/adblock/hoster.txt`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's Most Abused TLDs`: `https://gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror/-/raw/main/dns-blocklists/adblock/spam-tlds-ublock.txt`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi Multi PRO++`: `https://gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror/-/raw/main/dns-blocklists/adblock/pro.plus.txt`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's Threat Intelligence Feeds`: `https://gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror/-/raw/main/dns-blocklists/adblock/tif.txt`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi/xRuffKez's Newly Registered Domains (14 days)`: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xRuffKez/NRD/main/nrd-14day_adblock.txt`

* ⭐️ `OISD - Big`: `https://big.oisd.nl`

Additionally, if you're fine with a little breakage, I would highly recommend:

* ⭐️ My `BadBlock` **+** instead of `BadBlock`: `https://codeberg.org/celenity/BadBlock/raw/branch/main/abp/badblock_plus.txt`

* ⭐️ `1Hosts Pro`: `https://o0.pages.dev/Pro/adblock.txt`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi Multi` **Ultimate** instead of `HaGezi Multi` **Pro++**: `https://gitlab.com/hagezi/mirror/-/raw/main/dns-blocklists/adblock/ultimate.txt`

Once you're finished choosing your lists, don't forget to select **Apply changes** & **Update now**.

# My filters

This is where it can really depend on you and your set-up. I'll provide my recommendations and filters here I myself use below:

First, I would highly recommend setting the following to protect against [IDN Homograph attacks](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack) *You don't need to set this if your DNS provider already provides IDN Homograph Attacks Protection (i.e. NextDNS)*:

`xn--*`

`xn--*$doc,popup,frame`

I usually set the following to always enforce blocking Google's Doubleclick & Google Analytics: *((Why?)[https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Privacy-stuff])*

`||doubleclick.net^$important`
`||google-analytics.com^$important`

Additionally, I set the following to block social media tracking on websites:

`||facebook.com^$important,third-party`

`||facebook.net^$important,third-party`

`||linkedin.com^$important,third-party`

`||instagram.com^$important,third-party`

`||tiktok.com^$important,third-party`

`||twitter.com^$third-party`

`||x.com^$third-party`

*See `My rules` section below for unbreaking X/Twitter...*

I also set this to block [tracking from Gravatar](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Privacy-stuff):

`||gravatar.com^$important,third-party`

I also set these rules to block 3rd party sign-in prompts from Google & Apple, as they're 1: annoying and 2: a tracking concern:

`||accounts.google.com^$third-party`

`||appleid.apple.com^$third-party`

`||appleid.cdn-apple.com^$third-party`

`@@||accounts.google.com^$domain=youtube.com|chromium.org|gstatic.com|googleusercontent.com`

`@@||appleid.apple.com^$domain=appleid.cdn-apple.com`

`@@||appleid.cdn-apple.com^$domain=appleid.apple.com`

Since I block all 3rd-party requests *(will be explained further in `My rules` section below)*, I set the following rules to still allow CAPTCHAs for sites: *(Also see `My rules`)*

`||challenges.cloudflare.com^$third-party`

`@@||challenges.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/$third-party,script,frame`

`||www.google.com^$third-party,subdocument`

`@@||www.google.com/recaptcha/$third-party,subdocument`

`||www.gstatic.com^$third-party,script`

`@@||www.gstatic.com/recaptcha/$third-party,script`

Finally, I usually set the following to block the annoying banner on Old Reddit promoting Reddit's new UI.

`www.reddit.com###redesign-beta-optin-btn`

`old.reddit.com###redesign-beta-optin-btn`

Once you are done here, make sure to select **Apply changes**.

# My rules

First, I typically set the following to block all 3rd party requests:

**I would not recommend this for most people, as you will basically have to unbreak pages yourself, but it provides the most private, secure, and fastest configuration possible.**

`* * 3p block`
`* * 3p-frame block`
`* * 3p-script block`

If you don't want as much breakage, you could potentially only set:

`* * 3p-frame block`

This only blocks 3rd party frames, while keeping other resources untouched. I would recommend this if you have the tolerance to allow 3rd party frames for pages that need them.

I then set the following to allow CAPTCHAs for sites:

`* challenges.cloudflare.com * noop`

`* www.google.com * noop`

`* www.gstatic.com * noop`

I also set the following to unbreak X/Twitter based off the filters we set above:

`x.com twitter.com * noop`

`twitter.com x.com * noop`

⭐️ If you block 3rd party connections like me, then I would strongly recommend also using the [LocalCDN](https://www.localcdn.org/) extension with the following settings, as this will reduce breakage:

# LocalCDN -> Basic

**Hide donation button** -> ✅

# LocalCDN -> Advanced

**Block Google Fonts** -> ❌ *This is already covered by Yokoffing's `Block third party fonts` list that we added, leaving Google Fonts blocked here as well will just cause issues & breakage*

<br>

Now, back to uBlock Origin, you should add the following rules in uBlock Origin for LocalCDN to be active:

# Additional recommendations

* Use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) with my [Phoenix](https://phoenix.celenity.dev), as it respects your privacy and [has the best support for uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox).

* Enable Safe Browsing in your browser if possible and if it's not done in a privacy-invasive way. (You should use i.e. [Google Safe Browsing on "Standard" Mode](https://safebrowsing.google.com/), [Firefox's Safe Browsing](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-does-phishing-and-malware-protection-work), & [Brave's Safe Browsing](https://brave.com/privacy/browser/#safe-browsing), you should avoid most other options i.e. [Google Safe Browsing on "Enhanced" Mode](https://safebrowsing.google.com/), [Microsoft SmartScreen](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/operating-system-security/virus-and-threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/), & [Opera Sitecheck](https://blogs.opera.com/security/2021/01/making-browsing-safe-from-phishing/)).

* Use a private, secure, & reputable DNS provider of your choice. I would recommend setting up your own [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) configuration if you are able to *(See my recommendations for NextDNS [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/nextdns-settings))*, otherwise I would recommend [Quad9](https://quad9.net/). *(Even if you have a private/secure DNS provider set on your OS/network level, make sure to also set it in your browser as well, so that you can take advantage of [Encrypted Client Hello](https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello))*

* Use a (reputable) anti-virus if possible. On Windows, you can use the built-in [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Defender_Antivirus), on macOS, you can stick to the built-in [XProtect](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/protecting-against-malware-sec469d47bd8/web), on Android, you can use [Hypatia](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.malwarescanner/), and on Linux, you can use [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/). **NOTE:** You should install Hypatia through the [DivestOS Official Repo](https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/?fingerprint=E4BE8D6ABFA4D9D4FEEF03CDDA7FF62A73FD64B75566F6DD4E5E577550BE8467) instead of F-Droid's main repo, as it will allow you to receive quicker updates directly from the developer. It's also recommended to use [F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.basic/) as your F-Droid client of choice.
